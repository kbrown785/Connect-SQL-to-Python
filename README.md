# Connect-SQL-to-Python

## Getting Started
1. Get access to the ec-app10.test.econ.census.gov server.
2. Once you get access
   1. Go to Windows PowerShell, type `ssh -L 1234:localhost:1234 JBID@ec-app10.test.econ.census.gov`, and push Enter.
      1. The "1234 should be any 4 digits that don't give you an error.
      2. JBID = your JBID
   2. Enter network password and push "Enter". It won't show you typing.
   3. Type `source /apps/anaconda/bin/activate cfsenv` and push Enter.
   4. Type `jupyter lab --port=1234` and push Enter.
   5. You will see something that says, "Or copy and paste one of these URLs:" and it will list 2 URLs. I tried copy and pasting the first one into my browser and JupyterLab opened.
   6. You will see a list of folders on the left-hand side of the screen. You can keep your files wherever you want. I'm going to double-click on "Documents".
   7. Click on my "sql_to_python.ipynb" file in GitHub and copy and paste the code to your .ipynb.
   8.
